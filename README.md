# Voice2LocalDocsLLMs
Create a RAG To Chat with local documents Voice 2 Voice.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation. This approach combines traditional information retrieval techniques with generative language models to enhance the quality and relevance of the generated text. 

The Difference here is that I created a conversational chat agent that uses Voice to ask for information about the documentation, For example, I used Nostradamus recompilation predictions and information about him creating a live character that you can converse with him as it was present with you here and now.
